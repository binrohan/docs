# Swagger & Swashbuckle

## What is Swagger ?
Swagger aka OpenAPI Specification helps make information about how to use an API more accessible and understandable for developers. It's like a friendly guide that explains how to talk to a piece of software so that different programs can work together effectively.

Letâ€™s learn some swagger features to make our .NET web api project more accessible for other developers.

First we need to know about **What is Swashbuckle ?**
Swashbuckle is a library for the .NET platform that integrates with .NET Web API projects. It's specifically designed to work with Swagger. Swashbuckle helps generate Swagger documentation automatically for your ASP.NET Web API.

## How Swashbuckle Works:
- **Build Process**: When you build your .NET application, _Swagger_ examines the API controllers, actions, and associated attributes in your code.
- **OpenAPI JSON Generation**: _Swagger_ dynamically generates the OpenAPI Specification in JSON format based on the information gathered during the build process.
- **Swagger UI or Documentation Endpoint**: he generated OpenAPI JSON can be exposed through a UI (HTML, CSS, JS) or a dedicated endpoint in your application, allowing developers to interactively explore the API documentation.

### Now we see, there are **Three Main Components in Swashbuckle**.
- **Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.SwaggerGen**: A Swagger generator that builds SwaggerDocument objects directly from your routes, controllers, and models. It's typically combined with the Swagger endpoint middleware to automatically expose Swagger JSON.
- **Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.Swagger**: A Swagger object model and middleware to expose SwaggerDocument objects as JSON endpoints.
- **Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.SwaggerUI**: an embedded version of the Swagger UI tool. It interprets Swagger JSON to build a rich, customizable experience for describing the web API functionality. It includes built-in test harnesses for the public methods. 

## Installation:
Add **Swashbuckle** nuget package in web api project:

.NET CLI: `dotnet add TodoApi.csproj package Swashbuckle.AspNetCore`

Package Manager: `Install-Package Swashbuckle.AspNetCore`

Add the swagger generator to the service collection:
```C#
builder.Services.AddSwaggerGen();
```

Add swagger middlewares:
```C#
app.UseSwagger(); 
app.UseSwaggerUI();
```
_NB: ASP.NET Core WebAPi Project comes with Swagger_

## Configuration and Settings:
We can display more information about the project by passing options as parameter while adding SwaggerGen service.
```C#
builder.Services.AddSwaggerGen(options =>
{
    options.SwaggerDoc("v1", new OpenApiInfo
    {
        Version = "v1",
        Title = "Project Name",
        Description = "Project Description",
        TermsOfService = new Uri("https://example.com/terms"),
        Contact = new OpenApiContact
        {
            Name = "Contact Info",
            Url = new Uri("https://example.com/contact")
        },
        License = new OpenApiLicense
        {
            Name = "License Info",
            Url = new Uri("https://example.com/license")
        }
    });
});
```

## Customize Swagger UI:
To add custom CSS and JS follow this steps

```C#
app.UseStaticFiles();
```
This line enable evering static files from wwwroot directory

```C#
app.UseSwaggerUI(options =>
{
    options.InjectStylesheet("/swagger/style.css");
    options.InjectJavascript("/swagger/script.js");
});
```
Pass the url of CSS or JS file path through the options in UseSwaggerUI middleware

## Adding Authentication:
To add Token based authentication add options in Swagger Generator service
```C#
builder.Services.AddSwaggerGen(options =>
{
    //...
    options.AddSecurityDefinition("Bearer", new OpenApiSecurityScheme
    {
        In = ParameterLocation.Header,
        Description = "Please enter token",
        Name = "Authorization",
        Type = SecuritySchemeType.Http,
        BearerFormat = "JWT",
        Scheme = "bearer"
    });

    options.AddSecurityRequirement(new OpenApiSecurityRequirement
    {
        {
            new OpenApiSecurityScheme
            {
                Reference = new OpenApiReference
                {
                    Type=ReferenceType.SecurityScheme,
                    Id="Bearer"
                }
            },
            new string[]{}
        }
    });
    //...
});

```

## Documentation Formatting:
We can format documentation using couple methods. Such as
- XML
- Data Annotations
- ProducesReponseType
- Produces
- Consumes
- Example
- IOperationFilter
- Custom Attribute
