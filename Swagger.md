# Swagger & Swashbuckle

## What is Swagger ?
Swagger aka OpenAPI Specification helps make information about how to use an API more accessible and understandable for developers. It's like a friendly guide that explains how to talk to a piece of software so that different programs can work together effectively.

Letâ€™s learn some swagger features to make our .NET web api project more accessible for other developers.

First we need to know about **What is Swashbuckle ?**
Swashbuckle is a library for the .NET platform that integrates with .NET Web API projects. It's specifically designed to work with Swagger. Swashbuckle helps generate Swagger documentation automatically for your ASP.NET Web API.

## How Swashbuckle Works:
- **Build Process**: When you build your .NET application, _Swagger_ examines the API controllers, actions, and associated attributes in your code.
- **OpenAPI JSON Generation**: _Swagger_ dynamically generates the OpenAPI Specification in JSON format based on the information gathered during the build process.
- **Swagger UI or Documentation Endpoint**: he generated OpenAPI JSON can be exposed through a UI (HTML, CSS, JS) or a dedicated endpoint in your application, allowing developers to interactively explore the API documentation.

### Now we see, there are **Three Main Components in Swashbuckle**.
- **Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.SwaggerGen**: A Swagger generator that builds SwaggerDocument objects directly from your routes, controllers, and models. It's typically combined with the Swagger endpoint middleware to automatically expose Swagger JSON.
- **Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.Swagger**: A Swagger object model and middleware to expose SwaggerDocument objects as JSON endpoints.
- **Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.SwaggerUI**: an embedded version of the Swagger UI tool. It interprets Swagger JSON to build a rich, customizable experience for describing the web API functionality. It includes built-in test harnesses for the public methods. 

## Installation:
Add **Swashbuckle** nuget package in web api project:
`dotnet add TodoApi.csproj package Swashbuckle.AspNetCore`

Add the swagger generator to the service collection:
`builder.Services.AddSwaggerGen();`

Add swagger middlewares:
```
app.UseSwagger(); 
app.UseSwaggerUI();
```
